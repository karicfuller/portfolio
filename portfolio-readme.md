## Website Set-up

* _set-up a new project directory through the terminal_
* _initialized Git_
* _used Atom for editing .html files and README_
* _performed multiple commits in the terminal to keep track of changes made_
* _created a Git Repository_
* _performed multiple pushes when commits were performed_
* _used Markdown language to set up README_
* _referenced class documentation when needed_

_I advise viewing the website in either the web browser Chrome or Firefox._
